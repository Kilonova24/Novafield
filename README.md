  * Tip: Transfer grenades and mines to the Smart Inventory to set a carry limit on that item. You want to do this for the explosives you like or Smart Inventory will automatically transfer all of your grenades and mines to the ship’s inventory. You can keep transferring a single Frag Grenade in your inventory to set the carry limit you want. Setting the Smart Inventory Frag Grenade to 5 will make it so you cannot pick up more than 5 Frag Grenades out in the world.

On the Advanced tab, click the Change button. Set the Initial Size and Maximum Size to 40960. If you are struggling for drive space, put it to at least 20000.
