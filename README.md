How to install Novafield.

PRE-INSTALL

Make sure you have a clean version of Starfield installed. If you modded Starfield with Vortex, you will have to reinstall the game.

Install Microsoft .NET v8.0 Desktop Runtime from this link if you do not already have it: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.5/dotnet-runtime-8.0.5-win-x64.exe

Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Runtime from this link if you do not already have it: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

Set your page file to 40GB. Right click the Start Button. Click System. Click Advanced Systems Settings. On the Advanced tab, click Settings in the Performance section. On the Advanced tab, click the Change button. Set the Initial Size and Maximum Size to 40960. If you are struggling for drive space, put it to at least 20000.

INSTALLATION

Download Wabbajack from the official site: https://www.wabbajack.org/. Install Wabbajack to a non protected folder (Not Program Files).

Download the Novafield Wabbajack Main File from here and extract it. https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/15309.

Go to where you installed Wabbajack and run Wabbajack.exe. Go to Browse lists tab. Click the Install from disk in the top right corner. Select the .wabbajack file you downloaded. This will load the list into Wabbajack.

Install the list. Choose where you want the modlist installed (make sure you have plenty of free space and put outside of a protected folder). Let Wabbajack do its work — it will download and install everything automatically.

POST-INSTALL

In MO2, make sure the dropdown menu is set to Novafield. Click Run on the top right. Go to the Creations Menu in game and download the following mods: 

Deimog (This is the only one that’s required)
At Hell's Gate
Take Your Time - At Hells Gate Patch
The Perfect Recipe
Vendor Credits Gameplay Option - Greatly Increased is Normal
Improved Power - Supernova
Improved Power - Particle Beam
Sense Star Stuff Improved

Exit the game. In MO2, click the blue Refresh button on the top. Click the Sort button on the Plugins tab under Novafield. If it successfully sorts, you are good to click Run and start a new game. Have fun!

NOTE: Just like the Vortex version, I recommend making a save and quitting the game after you leave the Alternate Start area. Some mods will not load until you quit and reload the game.
