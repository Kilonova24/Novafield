* <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/13677">Smart Inventory</a>: Found in the Decorations builder in your ship under the Miscellaneous tab. Will automatically transfer resources and other items (like ammo you are not using) to your ship’s inventory whenever you enter your ship.
  * Tip: Transfer grenades and mines to the Smart Inventory to set a carry limit on that item. You want to do this for the explosives you like or Smart Inventory will automatically transfer all of your grenades and mines to the ship’s inventory. You can keep transferring a single Frag Grenade in your inventory to set the carry limit you want. Setting the Smart Inventory Frag Grenade to 5 will make it so you cannot pick up more than 5 Frag Grenades out in the world.

# Requirements
Bethesda's [minimum required computer specs](https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/60442).

The latest Steam version (1.15.222) of the game and the Shattered Space DLC.

## Recommended Specs
32gb Ram 

12gb VRAM GPU

SSD (This is required; I wouldn't run vanilla Starfield on an HDD)

For Ultrawide Support, join the Discord.

## Pre-install

Note: Please join the Discord for support if you run into any issues. 

1. Make sure you have a clean version of Starfield installed. If you modded Starfield with Vortex, you will have to reinstall the game.

2. Install Microsoft .NET v8.0 Desktop Runtime from this link if you do not already have it: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.5/dotnet-runtime-8.0.5-win-x64.exe

3. Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Runtime from this link if you do not already have it: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

4. Set your page file to 40GB. Right click the Start Button. Click System. Click Advanced Systems Settings. On the Advanced tab, click Settings in the Performance section. On the Advanced tab, click the Change button. Set the Initial Size and Maximum Size to 40960. If you are struggling for drive space, put it to at least 20000.

## Installation

1. Download Wabbajack from the official site: https://www.wabbajack.org/. Install Wabbajack to a non protected folder (Not Program Files).

2. Download the Novafield Wabbajack Main File from here and extract it. https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/15309.

3. Go to where you installed Wabbajack and run Wabbajack.exe. Go to Browse lists tab. Click the Install from disk in the top right corner. Select the .wabbajack file you downloaded. This will load the list into Wabbajack.

4. Install the list. Choose where you want the modlist installed (make sure you have plenty of free space and put outside of a protected folder). Let Wabbajack do its work — it will download and install everything automatically.

## Post-install

In MO2, make sure the dropdown menu is set to Novafield. Click Run on the top right. Go to the Creations Menu in game and download the following mods: 

* Deimog (This is the only one that’s required)

* At Hell's Gate

* Take Your Time - At Hells Gate Patch

* The Perfect Recipe

* Vendor Credits Gameplay Option - Greatly Increased is Normal

* Sense Star Stuff Improved

Exit the game. In the left pane of MO2, click the CK Mods dropdown. You should see seven empty mods. Double click the red Overwrite tab at the bottom of the left pane. Manually drag the Creations you just installed to their empty plugins. Deimog's files are the three sfbgs019 files. At Hell's Gate files are the four kgcdoom files and the take your time file at the bottom. The Perfect Recipe's files are the eight sfbgs00c files. 

Make sure you click the checkbox on the now installed plugins. Click the blue Refresh button on the top. Click the Sort button on the Plugins tab under Novafield. If it successfully sorts, you are good to click Run and start a new game. If sorting comes back with an error, join the Discord for support.

Interacting with the Surgical Bed in the Alternate Start area after you buy modded items from the terminal will cause a CTD. All the Surgical bed does is bring you back into the CharGenMenu, so avoid it for now. I'll be patching it soon. I recommend making a save and quitting the game after you leave the Alternate Start area. Some mods will not load until you quit and reload the game. 

You can start the main quest in a few ways: 
1. By choosing Vanilla when starting a new game.
2. By finding the artifact in a procedurally generated cave while exploring POIs. (Join the Discord if you can't find it)
3. By visiting the Valberg Building in New Atlantis. Talking to the receptionist will auto start the intro sequence for the game. All of your stuff will be moved to a locker that you can access after you complete the intro sequence in the mine.
   
NOTE: The mod Auto Hide HUD and Widgets will not work until the main quest is started. There is a Narrative Adjustment Data Slate in the alternate start area that lets you auto complete the "One Small Step" quest which will activate this mod. Doing this means you will have to find the artifact in a procedurally generated cave to officially start the main quest.
